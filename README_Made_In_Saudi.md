## 🎯 Overview

"Made in Saudi" is a Virtual Reality project that promotes local Saudi products by bringing together a variety of small shops in a single immersive marketplace. Users can walk around, explore stores, and interact with products in a realistic way.

## 🛍️ Why VR?

- Traditional online shopping lacks interactivity and immersion.
- Small businesses struggle to reach wider audiences.

Using VR, we created an interactive environment that mimics real-world shopping, enhancing product interaction and user experience.
