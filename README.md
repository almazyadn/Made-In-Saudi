## 🎯 Overview

"Made in Saudi" is a Virtual Reality project designed to showcase and support local Saudi businesses through an immersive and interactive shopping experience.  
Users can walk around a virtual marketplace featuring different Saudi stores, interact with 3D products, listen to recorded guides explaining each booth’s offerings, and even access each store’s website directly to make purchases.  
This project aims to create a modern, culturally rich shopping experience while helping small businesses expand their digital presence.

## ❓ Why VR?

Traditional online shopping often feels flat and disconnected.  
Using VR, we recreated the atmosphere of real-world browsing, offering a deeper emotional connection and a more memorable shopping journey.  
VR allows users to move between stores naturally, explore products visually, and engage with the culture through audio, visuals, and interaction.
